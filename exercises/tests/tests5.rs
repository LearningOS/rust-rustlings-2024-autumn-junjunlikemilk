//
// An `unsafe` in Rust serves as a contract.
//
// When `unsafe` is marked on an item declaration, such as a function,
// a trait or so on, it declares a contract alongside it. However,
// the content of the contract cannot be expressed only by a single keyword.
// Hence, its your responsibility to manually state it in the `# Safety`
// section of your documentation comment on the item.
//
// When `unsafe` is marked on a code block enclosed by curly braces,
// it declares an observance of some contract, such as the validity of some
// pointer parameter, the ownership of some memory address. However, like
// the text above, you still need to state how the contract is observed in
// the comment on the code block.
//
// NOTE: All the comments are for the readability and the maintainability of
// your code, while the Rust compiler hands its trust of soundness of your
// code to yourself! If you cannot prove the memory safety and soundness of
// your own code, take a step back and use safe code instead!
//
// Execute `rustlings hint tests5` or use the `hint` watch subcommand for a
// hint.
